## 📘 Abstract

**SCRAPET** is an AI-powered tool designed to **analyze, detect, and regulate data** generated or extracted through other Generative AI systems.  
Our platform provides multi-functional features including **AI-generated code detection**, **response minimization**, and **image & URL scraping**.

---

## 🚨 Problem Statement

With the increasing use of Generative AI, massive amounts of content — including code, text, and images — are produced automatically.  
This raises key challenges:
- Difficulty authenticating original data.  
- Trouble distinguishing between AI-generated and human-created content.  
- Ethical concerns in web scraping and data collection.  

Developers and educational institutions struggle to **detect AI-generated code**, **differentiate content origin**, and **maintain data integrity** during scraping.  
Hence, a robust **AI-driven solution** is required to address these challenges effectively.

---

## 💡 Solution

**SCRAPET** provides an **Access-Gated Dashboard** that serves as a central hub for all functionalities.  
Depending on the user’s **Access Level**, they can use tools like:
- AI-generated Code Detection  
- Response Minimization  
- Image Scraping  
- URL Scraping  

Each query generates output based on the **user’s prompts and custom specifications** — allowing users to decide the **size, limit, and depth** of results.

## ⚙️ Features

### 🧾 Prompt Scraping
Prompt Scraping refers to extracting or collecting prompts (text instructions given to AI models) from different sources — websites, AI communities, APIs, or datasets.

**Key Capabilities:**
- Access up-to-date web information instantly.  
- Use follow-up prompts for deeper and refined results.  
- Capture the latest trends and insights efficiently.  

---

### 💻 AI-Generated Code Detection
Identifies whether a given piece of code was written by a human or generated by an AI (e.g., ChatGPT, Copilot).

**Key Capabilities:**
- Analyzes coding style, syntax, and structure patterns.  
- Compares code similarity with known AI outputs.  
- Detects mixed (human + AI) authored code.  

---

### 🌐 URL Scraping
Extracts data from websites by analyzing HTML content automatically.

**Key Capabilities:**
- Automatically collect text, links, images, and metadata.  
- Retrieve precise data points for further analysis.  
- Store scraped data for detailed offline review.  

---

## 🔍 Working Mechanism

### 🧾 Prompt Scraping
1. Users access the open dashboard to input their prompts.  
2. The system collects and processes prompts from various data sources.  
3. Users can define response limitations (depth, type, etc.).  
4. Follow-up prompts enhance understanding and interactivity.  
5. The solution provides a **controlled and user-centric** experience.  

---

### 💻 AI Code Detection
1. Users open the dashboard and submit code for analysis.  
2. The system evaluates syntax, structure, and style patterns.  
3. Generates a report indicating whether the code is **AI-generated** or **human-written**.  
4. Particularly beneficial for **IT companies** and **academic institutions**.  

---

### 🌐 URL Scraping
1. Users open the URL scraping dashboard module.  
2. They input website URLs for automated extraction.  
3. The system fetches and processes text, links, images, and metadata.  
4. Results are displayed in a structured, exportable format.  

---

## 🚀 Future Scope

### 👨‍💻 IT Companies (AI Code Detection)
- Use SCRAPET to evaluate coding interviews and submissions.  
- Ensure candidate submissions are **legitimate** and **human-written**.

### 🎓 Educational Institutes (Prompt Scraping)
- Assist teachers in **developing study materials**.  
- Help students **generate contextual academic insights** efficiently.
